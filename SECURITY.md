# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Security updates are applied to the latest release on the `main` branch. If you are using an older release, please upgrade to the newest version before reporting issues.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security issues privately so we can investigate and address them responsibly.

Preferred contact:

- GitHub Security Advisories: [https://github.com/RageAgainstThePixel/unity-cli/security/advisories](https://github.com/RageAgainstThePixel/unity-cli/security/advisories)

If you cannot use GitHub Security Advisories, open a minimal issue and request a private channel; do not include sensitive details in public issues.

When reporting, please include:

- A clear description of the issue and impact
- Steps to reproduce (proof-of-concept or minimal example)
- Affected versions, if known
- Any relevant logs or configuration details (redact secrets)

## Disclosure Process

We follow responsible disclosure practices:

- We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 5 business days
- We will work on a fix and coordinate a release
- We will credit reporters who want acknowledgment

## Out of Scope

The following are generally out of scope:

- Issues in outdated or unsupported versions
- Social engineering or physical attacks
- Denial of service issues that require unreasonable traffic volumes
- Vulnerabilities in dependencies without a direct impact on this project

## Security Updates

Security releases will be published through GitHub Releases and, when appropriate, GitHub Security Advisories.
